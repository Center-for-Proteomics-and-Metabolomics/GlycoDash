## Installation

You can run the development version of glycodash on your own pc like so:

1.  Install R and Rstudio: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
2.  Download the master branch as a zip file, then unzip and store the folder somewhere.
3.  Double click "glycodash.Rproj", this launch open Rstudio.
4.  In Rstudio: click file --\> open. Then in the glycodash-master folder, open "run_dev.R" in the dev folder.
5.  In Rstudio, click the "source" button, or use Ctrl+Shift+S, to start the Dashboard. A new Rstudio window should now open with the dashboard running. *(Rstudio might first ask you to install required packages. Accept this. For package requirements: see the DESCRIPTION file.*)
6.  
7.  Optional: in the Rstudio dashboard window, click "open in browser" (this should look better). The dashboard was tested in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

## Example 

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(glycodash)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
