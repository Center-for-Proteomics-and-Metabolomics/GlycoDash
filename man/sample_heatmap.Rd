\description{
Efficiently creates a heatmap for normalized glycan data by minimizing expensive operations
on unnecessary rows. Sample names are on the y-axis, glycans on the x-axis, for a specific cluster.
The function pre-filters the data before performing separation and sorting, consolidates faceting logic,
and uses vectorized operations for speed.
