\title{Convert serial dates with comments to dates}
\usage{
date_with_text(date_text_values, origin = "1899-12-30")
}
\arguments{
\item{date_text_values}{A column in a dataframe or tibble with serial dates in
the form of character strings.}

\item{origin}{The origin date used to calculate the serial dates. Defaults to
1899-12-30 (year-month-day) which is the origin used in Excel on Windows for
all dates from 1900-01-01 and on.}
}

\description{
\code{date_with_text()} tries to convert a vector with serial dates (given as
character strings) to objects of the class "Date". In Excel dates are stored
as serial numbers. These serial dates are the number of days passed since a
set origin date. When Excel data is read into R the serial dates are usually
recognized as dates and converted to objects of class "Date". However, when in
Excel a cell contains both a date and a comment, the column containing this
cell is no longer recognized as class "Date" and is instead converted to class
"Character". \code{date_with_text()} attempts to convert serial dates (given
as character strings) to objects of class "Date". If some serial dates include
comments, the function instead converts the serial dates to character strings
with the dates formatted as "year-month-day". \strong{Important: This function
can only be used within the function \code{\link[dplyr]{across}} from the
dplyr package!}
